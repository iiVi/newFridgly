Fridgly

Funtion: This app allows the user to add ingredients into either the 'fridge' or the 'pantry'.
From these locations, the user can use these ingredients to search for recipes that contain ingredients.
The 'pantry' is a location for ingredients that the user is assumed to always have. This feature is designed to provide a way for the user to check the search results against their base ingredients.
The 'fridge' is a location for recently aquired ingredients that the user wants to use for their search.
The search can be fine tuned to account for multiple parameters that ensure that the user recieves recipes that are tailored to his/her needs.
These parameters are as follows:
Piquant(spice) level
Salty level
Sweet level
Sour level
Bitter level
Meaty level
The search can also filter by holiday, alergen, cuisine type, course and diet.
To access this app, click the 'create user' button and make a user name as well as select any alergen you might have.
